# Car Insurance Prediction

## Overview

This repository focuses on predicting whether a health insurance customer would be interested in purchasing car insurance. The data stems from a campaign wherein existing health customers were inquired about their interest in car insurance. Machine learning models in this repository predict the `Result` variable, where `Result=1` indicates interest and `Result=0` signifies no interest.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises several features, including:

- `id`: Unique identifier for each customer
- `Gender`: Gender of the customer
- `Age`: Age of the customer
- `HasDrivingLicense`: Whether the customer has a driving license
- `RegionID`: Region identifier
- `Switch`: Information not provided, but likely pertains to whether the customer switched from another insurance provider or not
- `VehicleAge`: Age of the vehicle
- `PastAccident`: Whether the customer had a past accident
- `AnnualPremium`: The annual premium amount
- `SalesChannelID`: Sales channel identifier
- `DaysSinceCreated`: Days since the record was created
- `Result`: Target variable indicating interest in car insurance (`1` for interested, `0` for not interested)

## Code
